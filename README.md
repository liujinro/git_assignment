# Git Assignment - <liujinro>
a. What is an issue?
An issue is a tab in Github. It is easy to create and flexible enough to fit a variety of scenarios. We can use an issue to track work, give or receive feedback, collaborate on ideas or tasks, and communicate efficiently with others.

b. What is a pull request?
A pull request on GitHub is a method used in software development to inform team members that changes made in a repository are ready to be reviewed before being merged into another branch. This is a critical component of the GitHub Flow, which includes branching, making changes, creating a pull request, the review process, and approval and merge.

c. How do I open up a pull request?
Here are the main steps: 1. Create a Fork or a Branch; 2. Make the changes on the Pull request; 3.Push your Changes; 4. Create the Pull request when the assignment is ready; 5. Use pull request review and collaboration; 6. Merge the Pull request if needed. In summary, the following steps would open a pull request and oversee its changes.

d. Give me a step by step guide on how to add someone to your repository.
The following steps could guide you to add someone to your repository. 1. Open your own Github repository; 2. Go to repository settings; 3. Access the collaborator's section and click on the button "Invite a collaborator," and search their user's name to select the person you want to collaborate with.

e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?
Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It requires multiple developers to work on the same project without conflicting with each other and allows them to track and revert changes easily. On the other hand, GitHub is a web-based hosting service for repositories using Git. It provides a central location where developers can collaborate on code, track issues, and manage projects with additional features like pull requests, issue tracking, and wikis.

f. What does git diff do?
Git diff is a command that helps developers to review changes before committing. 

g. What is the main branch?
The main branch is the primary branch of a repository, where the source code is considered stable and is often the base from which all new features, improvements, or other branches are derived.

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?
No, we should not directly push our changes directly into the main branch. If we directly push the new repository to the main branch, it would change the main directly, and the source of the main would not be stable for the project. On the other hand, directly pushing to the main would cause the merge conflict that has to be fixed manually. In summary, avoiding pushing a new repository directly to the main branch not only maintains the integrity of the main branch but also improves the overall quality of the software development process.
